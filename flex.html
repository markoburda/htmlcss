                <div class="fb-el"><p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a
                    one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in
                    an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features
                    of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides. When we describe
                    flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one
                    dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the
                    two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.</p></div>
                <div class="fb-el"><p>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis
                    and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs
                    perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth
                    understanding how they work from the outset. Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox
                    makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily weighted
                    towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of
                    writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a
                    document and run towards the right hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.</p>

<p class="desc">You can also use the value space-between to take all the spare space after the items have been laid out,
    <br> and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each item.</p>
<div class="container middle-container">
    <div class="flex-layout">
        <div class="news"><p><b>justify-content</b> controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.
            The default value is flex-start, which makes all the items sit at the start of the main axis.
            You can use flex-end to make them sit at the end.
            center is also a value for justify-content, and will make the flex items sit in the center of the main axis.
            The value we've used above, space-around, is useful — it distributes all the items evenly along the main
            axis, with a bit of space left at either end.
            There is another value, space-between, which is very similar to space-around except that it doesn't leave
            any space at either end.</p></div>
        <div class="news"><p>Flexbox provides a property called <b>flex-direction</b> that specifies what direction the main
            axis runs in (what direction the flexbox children are laid out in) — by default this is set to row, which
            causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to
            right, in the case of an English browser).</p></div>
        <div class="news"><p><b>align-items</b> controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.

            By default, the value is stretch, which stretches all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the
            cross axis. If the parent hasn't got a fixed width in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will
            become as long as the longest flex items. This is how our first example got equal height columns by default.
            The center value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but
            be centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's buttons are centered vertically.
            You can also have values like flex-start and flex-end, which will align all items at the start and end of
            the cross axis respectively. See align-items for the full details.</p></div>
