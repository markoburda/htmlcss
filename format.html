<div class="container container-b">
    <h1 class="title">This page is dedicated to text formatting</h1>
    <div class="block b"><p>The HTML Bring Attention To element is used to draw the reader's attention to the
        element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the
        Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.</p>
        <p>Make literally anything look cooler by making parts of text <b>bold</b>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block italic">
    <p>The HTML i element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason. Some
        examples include technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. It is typically
        displayed in italic type.</p>
    <i>The cake is a lie</i>
    </div>
    <div class="block strong">
        <p>The HTML Strong Importance Element strong indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or
            urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
        </p>
        <strong>The cake is a lie</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="block emphasize">
        <p>The HTML em element marks text that has stress emphasis. The em element can be nested, with each level of
            nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.</p>
        <em>The cake is a lie</em>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="container container-a">
    <div class="block strikethrough">
        <p>The HTML s element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the s element to
            represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, s is not appropriate when
            indicating document edits; for that, use the del and ins elements, as appropriate.</p>
        <s>The cake is not a lie</s>
    </div>

    <div class="block underlined">
        <p>The HTML Unarticulated Annotation Element u represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in
            a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid
            underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
        <u>The cake IS a lie!</u>
    </div>

    <div class="block marked">
        <p>The HTML Mark Text element (mark) represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation
            purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context.
        </p>
        <mark>The cake is definitely a lie</mark>
    </div>

    <div class="block small">
        <p>The HTML smol element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent
            of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from small
            to
            x-small.</p>
        <hr>
        <small>This content is not licensed by anything but it looks cool so I'll leave my name here. Marko
            Burda</small>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="container container-b">
    <div class="block super">
        <p>The HTML Superscript element (sup) specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely
            typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.</p>
        <sup>Superscript</sup>
    </div>

    <div class="block sub">
        <p>The HTML Subscript element (sub) specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely
            typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>
        <sub>Subscript</sub>
    </div>
    <div class="block wbr">
        <p>The HTML wbr element represents a word break opportunityâ€”a position within text where the browser may
            optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.
            For instance, let's make
            <wbr>
            <b>pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</b>
            <wbr>
            break on resizing
