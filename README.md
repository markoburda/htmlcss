# htmlcss
Pure HTML/CSS website project

This project was designed to test my skills and see what can be done by using only HTML and CSS, no Javascript or any extensions, written purely from scratch.

The website is hosted at http://mbweb.work/; it contains 11 categories of materials and techniques used to build websites, each of which provides information followed by an example (sometimes hoverable/clickable)

The categories are:
  TEXT FORMATTING
  QUOTATIONS
  TABLES
  SEMANTICS
  LISTS
  FLEXBOX
  GRID (Use your mouse to hover over the rectangles in the final section)
  MEDIA QUERIES
  VIDEO
  IMAGES
  INPUT
  
All design ideas are my own and were created without using any references
The website also supports small screens and mobile devices and has a hamburger-style slide-in menu that replaces the original navigation bar.
